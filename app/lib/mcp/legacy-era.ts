// THE PRIOR-ERA SHIM. One module, one call site in server.ts, deletable as a unit. Copied from
// dustinedwards-mcp's src/legacy-era.ts, where the pattern was measured.
//
// ============================================================================
// REMOVAL CONDITION
// ============================================================================
// Delete this file and its single call site in app/lib/mcp/server.ts when the probe in
// dustinedwards-mcp (`node scripts/probe-report.mjs`) shows the clients that reach Carrel opening
// with `server/discover` instead of `initialize`.
//
// Targets and their last measurement (in dustinedwards-mcp; Carrel has no probe of its own):
//   Claude Code 2.1.203   2026-07-29   LEGACY (initialize, 2025-11-25)
//   claude.ai (Anthropic) 2026-07-30   LEGACY (initialize, 2025-11-25)
//
// Do NOT delete it on the strength of a release note or an announcement that a client "supports"
// the new revision. Re-run the probe and delete it on the capture.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. MCP 2026-07-28 removed the `initialize` handshake, sessions and the GET stream. The
// primary handler is built `legacy: "reject"`, stateless and modern-only. A legacy client against a
// modern-only server fails with no fall-forward, and both measured clients are legacy, so this shim
// is load-bearing today.
//
// WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. `createMcpHandler` could serve both eras from one handler with
// `legacy: "stateless"`, but then the compatibility path would live inside the library behind a
// flag. Routing in front of a `legacy: "reject"` handler, as the library documents on
// `isLegacyRequest`, makes the seam real: deleting this file leaves a modern-only server.
